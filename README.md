<p id="description">This is a website that pairs the user-friendly experience of Yelp with the vibrant visual features of Instagram creating an all-in-one platform where users can find ratings and reviews of places. It's the perfect place for discovering the best new spots while connecting with other users and experiencing the world's most interesting places. 

This is a full-stack application designed to provide a practical learning experience and is built using both front-end and back-end development techniques. The primary goal was to gain a deeper understanding of web development and to create a functional and well-designed application from scratch.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

While working on this project I faced some obstacles which allowed me to dive deeper into the complexities of web development and broaden my skill set. Along with creating reusable react components, I also learned how to develop endpoints for the back-end API, which enabled communication with the front-end user interface. Through this project, I gained a better understanding of full-stack development and how to incorporate SQL and databases into a larger project.
